# spu-kit: A SNES Sound Processing Unit (SPU) Emulator

Ideally, I want something more reliable than vspcplay which doesn't work on a
lot of inputs. And something faster than blargg, which sounds good but is a bit
slow. Also, some authoring tools eventually, maybe even a tracker.

Plus, generally, I just like writing emulators.
